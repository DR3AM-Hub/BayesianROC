Please read 'Bayesian ROC Tookit Documentation.docx' from the Github page for details.  
  
BayesianROC is a subclass of DeepROC (from the Deep ROC Toolkit).  It computes measures related to the Chance and Bayesian iso performance baselines and produces associated plots.  
  
Test_Binary_Chance.py, creates a BayesianROC object and performs classification and analysis.  Questions are asked as input: you may hit enter to accept defaults, except it is recommended that you change the costs to see the effect of Binary Chance.
